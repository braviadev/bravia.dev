## Who am I

I am a Full Stack Engineer from Kwara State, Nigeria—specifically from the city of Ilorin. I am in my early thirties and currently advancing my knowledge in TypeScript, Next.js, React.js, Node.js, and database management. At this stage of my career, I have developed a strong passion for web application development.

I started learning web development on August 15, 2011 (I was 16 years old). It's a big challenge because it's just one of my hobbies, and I have yet to take any courses. I am self-learning on YouTube. One of my favorite YouTube channels is [Any channel taltking talk](https://www.youtube.com). I learned a lot of web development skills from those channel.

I began learning web development on August 15, 2011, at the age of sixteen. It has been a significant challenge, largely because web development started as a personal hobby, and I did not initially enroll in any formal courses. Instead, I relied entirely on self-directed learning through YouTube. One of my preferred YouTube channels is [Any channel shoot tech on] (https://www.youtube.com), from which  I acquired many valuable web development skills.


I particularly enjoy using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build websites. TI host my code repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com). and deploy my applications using [Railway](https://railway.com) to deploy my website.

Thanks to **Timothy Lin** for the
[tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). It was helpful to me at a time when I had no understanding of how to build a blog from scratch. Although I initially followed a starter template, my final implementation differs significantly because I revised and modified a substantial portion of the original code. :)
